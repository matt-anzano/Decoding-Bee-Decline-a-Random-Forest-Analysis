# Decoding Bee Decline: a Random Forest Analysis

## Description

In this project, is studied bee colony losses in the United States over the period from 2015 to 2022. Using *Random Forest*, predictions of colony losses are obtained, and then, through the use of *SHAP Values*, we delve into the relationships between the response variable and the independent variables.

# Methods
- *Random Forest*
- *SHAP Values*


## Results and Output
The *Random Forest* yields accurate predictions, and through the *SHAP Values*, it is demonstrated that the decline in the last years is decreasing, especially showcasing the effective measures taken to combat winter decline.
